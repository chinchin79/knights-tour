# knights-tour
A knight's tour sequence problem solution done with Python

# Additional Hints:
A.  It is OK for a key to be used multiple times in the same sequence, subject to the length and
    number of vowel constraints only.  People familiar with the related-sounding "Knight's Tour" problem
    sometimes read in a requirement that the path never visit the same key twice.  That is NOT a part
    of this problem.
 
B.  The only thing actually required on the output is the number of sequences. 

C.  Some people are confused by the statement that paths ‘do not wrap.’ To clarify, what this
    means is that if a move goes off, say, the right edge of the board, it does not come back on the left. That is,
    the board is not on a cylinder or sphere or whatever. If a move would go off of the board, then it is not a
    legal move. It is not wrapped back onto the board.
